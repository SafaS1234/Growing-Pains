# Growing Pains

## Background
Implement a dynamic array structure to store integers. Also, allow it to grow by one if the user tries to add an integer when the array is already full.

### Set Up
Open in VS Code and run.

### Running the Test Suite

How does a new user run your test suite or driver program? Ideally, you want this to be general for any new developer, but for the time being you can list the specific steps that you take to build the project on YOUR system.

1. Do this thing first.
2. Do this thing second.
3. Do this thing third.
4. Do this thing fourth.

## Helpful Checklist

This is just a helpful checklist that you can use to make sure that you project is ready for review. Feel free to delete this section when you are done with it.

- [ ] Code is well-organized and easy to read
- [ ] Code is tested via driver functions, assertions, or a combination of both (as appropriate)
- [ ] README has been filled out
- [ ] LICENSE file has been included (totally optional, but you can add one if you want)
